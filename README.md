---As part of my digital marketing internship, I was assigned to create a social media post calendar. This task involved planning and organizing content for various social media platforms to ensure consistency and engagement. I conducted research on trending topics, audience preferences, and effective posting schedules. Additionally, I categorized posts into promotional, informational, and engagement-based content to maintain a balanced strategy. I also ensured that the calendar aligned with the brandâ€™s goals and included captions, hashtags, and media assets for each post. This structured approach helps streamline content posting, improve audience engagement, and enhance brand visibility.
